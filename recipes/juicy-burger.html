    <h1>Juicy Lucy Cheddar Burgers</h1>

    <img src="../images/juicy-burgers.jpg" alt="">

    <p>These juicy Lucy Cheddar burgers are absolutely loaded with gooey Cheddar cheese sealed within 2 patties. They are grilled to perfection with a surprise inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and garlic salt together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
    <li>Form into eight thin patties, each slightly larger than a cheese slice.</li>
    <li>Cut each slice of American cheese into 4 equal pieces; stack the pieces.</li>
    <li>Sandwich one stack of cheese between 2 ground beef patties.</li>
    <li>Tightly pinch the edges together to seal around the cheese. Be sure to seal tightly, or the cheese will burst through when cooked. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.</li>
    <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until well browned, about 4 minutes; they will puff up due to steam from the melting cheese.</li>
    <li>Flip patties, prick the tops to release steam, and cook until browned on the other side and no longer pink in the center; about 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
</ol>
